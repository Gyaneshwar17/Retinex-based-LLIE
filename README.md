# Retinex-based-LLIE
This repository explores low-light image enhancement (LLIE) using Retinex theory and diffusion models. The focus is on testing the decomposition of images into reflectance and illumination maps using methods like Retinex-Net, with enhancements applied to illumination for improved low-light image quality.
